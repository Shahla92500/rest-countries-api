### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of is :function=> "attachCountryCardHandlers" and displayCountry.js </h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I will continue on work on :
 - layer adjusment by CSS & TailWind
 - Responsive mode to have better result and be faster
 - Dark mode using React

### Useful resources

- Abraham guideline- This helped me for understanding creating a template and use it dynamically. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to pass the values of one html page to another. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
